This project includes a series of data analysis tasks performed on bike rental data using MATLAB.

1. Distribution fitting for hourly rentals across different seasons

2. Goodness-of-fit tests to compare distributions between seasons

3. Hypothesis testing on rental differences across hours of the day

4. Bootstrap confidence intervals for median rentals on holidays vs. non-holidays
